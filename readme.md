# Point Church

## Overview

This repo is the wordpress installation for The Point Church in The Triangle, NC.

## Tech Stack

CMS: Wordpress

Hosting: WPEngine

SASS Build tool: Compass

JS Library: jQuery

## Contributing

We are moving toward using the Airbnb javascript style guide. All javascript refactoring should use those precidents. [Airbnb javascript styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Staging Environment

WPEngine includes a 1-click staging environment. It works great for keeping a staging environment in-sync with production. Additionally we use git deployments to both production and staging.

## Major To-Dos:

* Convert Compass to Gulp
* Add modular templating to the theme to enable page creation
