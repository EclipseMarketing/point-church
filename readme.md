## Contributing

We are moving toward using the Airbnb javascript style guide. All javascript refactoring should use those precidents. [Airbnb javascript styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Staging Environment

WPEngine includes a 1-click staging environment. It works great for keeping a staging environment in-sync with production. Additionally we use git deployments to both production and staging. [Read the documentation](https://wpengine.com/support/set-git-push-user-portal)

The URL for the staging repo is currently: git@git.wpengine.com:staging/pointchurch.git

## Major To-Dos:

* Convert Compass to Gulp
